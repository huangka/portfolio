       <h2>Background</h2>
       <p>There are many barriers that prevent college-age eligible voters 
         from voting: My task for this project was all about leveraging visual communication design to make voting more visible, less confusing — and fun.
        By learning the ins and outs of the registration and voting processes in Michigan (and other states), 
        I then created assets that helps motivate my peers and helps them better navigate this vital civic opportunity! </p>

        <p>Time constraints: 3 weeks</p>

      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Research: learning the ins and outs of the registration and voting processes </h2>
        <p>The first step in the process was to become fully informed about every part of the 
          processes pertaining to voter registration and voting (especially the  many unique 
          challenges this election year. I focused on creating explainers to help students navigate 
          the voter registration process, so I focused on immersing myself in research on every detail 
          for voter registration in the state of Michigan as well as understanding the various barriers 
          that prevent many students from registering.  Several key insights I gleaned from research: </p>
         <br>
         <h3>1. Helping students make a plan to vote</h3>
         <br>
         <p>Many students understand the importance of voting, but it is making motivation actionable that 
           is the challenge. It's more important than ever to not just tell/encourage people to vote, 
           but give them the options and path for them to actually take action</p>
          <br>
          <h3>2. Alleviate barriers between students and information </h3>
          <br>
          <p>By presenting students with the exact information they need, 
            there is less of a deterrent of trying to find all content that they need from reliable sources. 
            Having everything on hand will help motivate students to do things immediately. </p>
          <br>
          <h3>3. Reduce confusion, make things more straight-forward</h3>
          <br>
          <p> Most student want to vote, it's about making it less overwhelming and guiding them through 
            step by step</p>
          <br>
          <h3>4. Advertise UMMA as a satellite office for Ann-Arbor voters </h3>
          <br>
          <p>Showcase the University of Michigan's Museum of Art as a satellite office for all Ann-Arbor voters voting needs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Considering context</h2>
        <p>The next step in the process was exploring a broad range of locations/modes/channels 
          for distributing my explainers. Where do students look to find voting information? 
          Where could they encounter voting information even if they aren’t 
          (and don’t know that they should be) looking for it? What opportunities can we find — or create — 
          in our new, socially-distanced, COVID-safe context to implement best practices about social norms and
           personal interactions? </p>
           <br>
           <p>Based on my experience and talking to fellow students, I picked flyers and posters, as they are the easiest and surest ways to disseminate the information to reach the most number of students. 
          </p>
    
      </div>

    

      <div class="project-text-left">
        <h2>First sketches: The flyer</h2>
        <p> Taking the principle of having everything a student would need to register to vote immediately 
          available gave me the idea of using QR codes to lead students to important links like the online 
          registration form or finding their local clerk. This is the easiest way, as students don't have to 
          go and comb through webpages to find what they're looking for or manually type in an address. 
          I also played with chunking, specifically outlining each chunk of information as a step: this helps 
          with walking people through the information to make it less confusing or overwhelming.</p>

      <div class="project-text-left">
  
        <h2>First sketches: The poster</h2>
        <p> I knew that QR codes would be less intuitive on a tabloid or larger sheet of paper, 
          so that helped me decide to use this mode to advertise the UMMA satalite office. 
          I played around with the UMMA statue, as it is recognizable (which is especially helpful for 
          freshman who don't know where the UMMA is) but also very visually interesting to work with.</p>

        <h2>Feedback for first drafts</h2>
        <p>The next step in the process was exploring a broad range of locations/modes/channels 
          for distributing my explainers. Where do students look to find voting information? 
          Where could they encounter voting information even if they aren’t 
          (and don’t know that they should be) looking for it? What opportunities can we find — or create — 
          in our new, socially-distanced, COVID-safe context to implement best practices about social norms and
           personal interactions? </p>
           <br>
           <p> Several key pieces of feedback: </p>
           <br>
           <h3>1. Pay attention to whitespace: it is an element, not an afterthought. 
             This is key to enhancing relationships between elements. </h3>
           <br>
            <h3>2. Go back to the drawing board and sketch out all the different ways you can 
              use whitespace and placement to strengthen cohesion and legibility, but also visual interest—the way 
              the eye moves through a space determines visual interest</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Make sure you are emphasizing the right pieces of information </h3>

      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Back to the drawing board</h2>
        <p>Based on the feedback from draft 1, I went back to the drawing board and sketched out multiple 
          thumbnails of both the poster and flyer to see how I could make the visual message as clear as 
          possible as well as visually interesting. I played around with size, shape, whitespace, orientation, 
          alignment, etc.  I also double checked that all pieces of information were accurate. 
        </p> <br>
        <p>When it came to the poster specifically, I played around with the size and orientation of the UMMA statue, seeing the ways
          in which I could make the flow of the page more visually dynamic, as well as how I could use the visual to segment the information
          on the page. Due to visual interest provided by the dimensions of the statue, this was a lot of fun to do!

        <h2>Feedback for second drafts</h2>
        <p>After completing the second round of drafts, I received more feedback from peers and my professor. 
        </p>
           <br>
           <p> Several key pieces of feedback I later implemented include: </p>
           <br>
           <h3>1. Reduce the amount of redundant information present </h3>
           <br>
            <h3>2. Line breaks are supposed to be intentional</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>3. Dates are important! Make important info more visually salient! </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>4. Textual information needs to be not only concise, but very accurate: there cannot be room for ambiguity! </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>5. Remember the main audience and tailor the information to their specific needs 
              (e.g. the full address of UMMA isn't necessary for students already on campus)</h3>
      </div>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>There were several key things that I learned by the end of this project:
        </p>
    
           <h3>1. The power of sketching:  don't just go with the first "ok" idea. 
             Try out as many options as possible</h3>
           <br>
            <h3>2. The power to shape editorial content: becoming knowledgable in the subject gives you,
              the designer, more power to shape the content you are given! </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>3. The challenge of the designer: making complex information look as effortless as possible </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>4. The power of feedback early and often. </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>5. The power of whitespace: it's not just an afterthought!</h3>
